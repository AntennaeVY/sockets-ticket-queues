# Ticket Queues

Welcome to my second project, this is a backend project made with NodeJS, Express, and SocketIO

This project is made for queue management with a ticket/desk system.

This project consists in 4 pages:

### 1.  Index

Main page which leads to the other 3 pages

### 2.  Create Tickets

You can create new tickets and then assignate any of them to a particular desk which will have the responsability to serve it, any ticket you create will be considered a pending ticket *(no desk assignated)*

### 3. Desk

You can go to any desk number and start serving tickets for that particular desk, any ticket you serve will be updated in the queue

### 4. Queue

You can see in real time which are the currently served tickets *(only displays the last 4)* and plays a sound everytime a new ticket is served

> **_Currently this project is deployed with Heroku, so it doesn't own an official domain._**
